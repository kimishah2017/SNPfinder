# Sprint 1

- What went well: We were able to come up with accurate user stories approved by our client. We also investigated databases to use and gained access to them. We also found an applet-form of the type of website we would like to create, which is a good model for the basic skeleton of our program. The applet form is outdated and does not provide the 3D structures of proteins, which verifies the need for our project. 
- What did not go well: Due to the fact that we were mostly exploring databases and websites, we were unable to begin actual coding for the project. 
- What can we do better next sprint: Begin coding!
- How can we do it better: Focus on a specific user story to begin parsing databases. 

## Future
- The user story we will focus on for the upcoming sprint is:
As a researcher, I want to create scripts in Python that can download and analyze missense mutations from online databases, such as the OMIM database, dbSNP database, and HGVbase database, to parse data more efficiently
- Kimi and Molly will both be working on this user story for this upcoming sprint.
- New Scrum Master: Kimi
